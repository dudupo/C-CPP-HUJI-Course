Hey again everyone!
This time i wrote a bit more extensive tests.
- So far there are only static tests, and i'm aiming towards writing random
ones as well. (if i have the time)
- If anyone has any ideas for more test cases, or finds an issue with the current
one, i would really appreciate it if you contact me. It helps all of us!
so lets work together to help each other!

YOU NEED:
    1. python compiler
    2. c compiler
    3. luck

HOW TO RUN TEST:
    1. Open the "TEST" directory.
    2. Put your "c_ex2.tar" tar file in the "YourFilesHere" folder.
    3. Double click on "run_tester.bat"
    4. If you pass all the tests - you will get a cool smiley face :)

IF THAT DOESN'T WORK: (your python key-word is probably saved differently)
    1. Open the "TEST" directory in Pycharm as a project.
    2. Make sure your project interpreter is version 3.7.
    3. Put your "c_ex2.tar" tar file in the "YourFilesHere" folder.
    4. Run "c_ex2_tester.py" through pycharm (WITHOUT PYTEST)
